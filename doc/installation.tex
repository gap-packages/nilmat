\atindex{Nilmat package}{@Nilmat package}

The Package \package{Nilmat} is a {\GAP} code only package and requires
no external binaries.

Once \package{Nilmat} is loaded, calls to the {\GAP} functions
`IsNilpotent', `IsNilpotentGroup', `SylowSubgroup', and
`SylowSystem' for subgroups of $GL(n,q)$, and calls to
`IsNilpotent', `IsNilpotentGroup', and `IsFinite' for subgroups of
$GL(n,\Q)$, automatically switch to corresponding functions
%(e.g. `IsNilpotentMatGroup')
from \package{Nilmat}. Thus \package{Nilmat} should be disabled if
one wishes to use the former {\GAP} functions for matrix groups
over $GF(q)$ or $\Q$.

For testing nilpotency and finiteness over $\Q$, the {\GAP}
package \package{Polenta} is also required. Note that `Nilmat'
does not use functions from \package{Polenta} which depend on
`KASH'. Hence to use \package{Nilmat}, `KASH' installation is not
required, and all \package{Nilmat} functions run under both
Windows and Linux.
